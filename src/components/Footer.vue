        As a developer primarily focused on Vue.js, I've created this web
        application to showcase my skills in building Vue.js projects,
        particularly in handling data fetching with Axios and structuring Vue.js
        applications.

        Please note that I'm not a designer, and the visual appearance of this
        web app may not meet professional design standards. The primary goal of
        this project is to demonstrate Vue.js development proficiency rather
        than visual aesthetics.
